# Basic-Intuition-of-Vectors-in-Machine-Learning
The Jupyter notebook  contains the complete implementation code of Vectors and mathematical operations on vectors. With the help of dataset I have explain the importance of vectors in the machine learning modeling.

I will be using the Diabetes Dataset, which is also available in kaggle. You can download it from here. The dataset contains 8 input features, which are the diagnostic measurements for each patient and the objective is to predict based on these diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes or not. The last output feature in the dataset is the Outcome, which is the status of the patient (either diabetic or not).

# Diabetes Dataset
  The dataset contains 9 columns. The column (Feature) description is as below.
  
    Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
    Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
    BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
    SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
    Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)Â²)
    DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
    Age: Age (years)
    Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
